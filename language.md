# Language & Text

## Tone

A consistent voice is key. The MC should be friendly, yet professional, and helpful without being irritating.

## Brevity

Keep sentences brief. More words dilute the message. Describe only what's necessary and no more.

### Examples

Here are a couple of examples of sentences and how they can be improved. They are taken from the *Writing Style* section of the [Android Developer Guidelines](http://developer.android.com/design/style/writing.html), where you can find more examples and guidelines.

## Nouns and Verbs

Be careful with noun and verb syntax. 

**Login** is a noun, e.g. *You will be taken to the login page*. **Log in** is a verb, e.g. *Please log in to proceed*.

## Casing

Take care with capitalising and uppercasing words.

### Capitalisation

Unless in a heading, button or other context where every word is capitalised, only [proper nouns](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proper_noun) should be capitalised.

**Note** - *internet* is not a proper noun and should not be capitalised.

### Uppercasing

Only acronyms should be displayed in uppercase.

## Device Agnostic Terminology

You can't assume that your user is using a device that has a keyboard and mouse. Because of this, refer to terms in a manner that is device independent. For example *select an option* is more suitable than *click an option*. Some other independent verbs are:

* Select
* Choose
* Pick

You shouldn't use *hit*, as this is too colloquial.

## Emphasis

To emphasise text, use <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;em&gt;</code>.
